 * Question 2 of Homework 5.
 * 
 * Given the Massachusetts highway map data, find two vertices in the graph such that 
 * the shortest distance between them is greater than any other pair of vertices in the graph.
 * 
 * In other words, can you find two locations in Massachusetts such that using the available 
 * map data, you’ve computed the shortest total distance in terms of accumulated mileage, 
 * and no other pair of vertices demands a longer trip.
